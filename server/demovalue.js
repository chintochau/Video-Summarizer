00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,471
OK, today we are going to the library(AI Generated En subtitles. There will be mistakes)

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:10,744
You must have seen such a title online:

3
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,346
"How I read 100 books in a year"

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,515
These contents may inspire you

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,885
But I believe that what most people feel is anxiety or inferiority

6
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,553
Because their reading speed is very slow

7
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:24,324
It seems like I can never become the kind of person who reads 100 books in a year

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:29,396
But as a content creator who reads a lot

9
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,932
I want to say you really don't need to read 100 books in a year

10
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,402
You shouldn't even consider quantity as your goal

11
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:39,039
You should not be anxious about your reading speed

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,275
Because quantity and speed are not the essence of reading

13
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,577
They are the result of reading

14
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,646
Not the goal you should pursue

15
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:51,684
In today's video, I want to talk about the essence of reading

16
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:54,954
What's wrong with setting quantity and speed as goals?

17
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:59,426
And the problems with audio books that claim to help you improve your speed

18
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,061
Why Speed Reading Techniques do not work

19
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:03,129
Why you should not use them at all?

20
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:07,100
Finally, I would like to share what our true goal should be in reading

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,505
People's pursuit of the quantity of reading is essentially based on a common belief

22
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,407
like many other things

23
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,876
"The more you read, the better. The faster, the better"

24
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:21,881
But ironically, when it comes to reading, once you treat quantity and speed as goals

25
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:24,284
You may instead end up on the wrong path

26
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,786
Because they are not the essence of reading

27
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:30,490
I have been reading the book "The Creative Act" recently

28
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,927
The author has a passage that vividly describes the essence of reading

29
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,496
I may come across a piece of writing that inspires me to think

30
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,532
At this moment, although my eyes continue to read down the page

31
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,534
But I no longer absorb new information

32
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:45,505
Because my thinking may still be immersed in the previous idea

33
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,773
When I realized this matter

34
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,475
I will return to the previous paragraph

35
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,076
Start reading from there again

36
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:53,213
Sometimes this is already the text from three or four pages ago

37
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:57,217
Actually, not only getting inspiration from books will make us pause and read repeatedly

38
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,652
Sometimes there are sentences that we really can't understand

39
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,654
So we need to repeatedly read the previous article

40
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,290
Sometimes the books we read may be in other languages

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,059
This will also affect our speed

42
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,162
Sometimes we read some content and find that previous chapters have mentioned it

43
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,398
So we might go back to read the previous content

44
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,168
Sometimes we read a sentence and it is just so enlightening

45
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,003
We have to stop and take notes

46
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,038
Even go to share and discuss with others

47
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,141
So did you see it?

48
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,744
The essence of reading is actually a process of thinking

49
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,380
The speed at which you think determines the speed at which you read

50
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,017
The speed of reading, rather than the other way around, determines the speed of thinking

51
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:34,420
Treating quantity and speed as goals is a kind of putting the cart before the horse

52
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,124
I just read this book a couple of days ago

53
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,460
There is a sentence inside it that deeply touched me

54
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,361
It says

55
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,962
You get what you measure

56
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,598
You will get what you measure

57
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,900
Then it told a joke inside

58
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,802
Just a group of fishermen going to get their fishing nets to catch fish

59
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,972
Then they measure the size of the smallest fish they caught

60
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,241
The size of being the smallest fish in the sea

61
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,543
This conclusion is obviously wrong

62
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,212
Because it is the size of your grid

63
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,980
The size determines how many fish you can catch

64
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,816
But this does not mean that the smallest fish in the sea is very big

65
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,853
So when your standards are wrong

66
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,655
Your result may also be wrong

67
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:13,660
When we prioritize the quantity and speed of reading as our goals

68
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,596
We are just counting and chasing time

69
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,165
At this point, you can imagine reading as

70
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,334
It is the operation of a scanner

71
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,236
If you analyze those on the market

72
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,239
The so-called tools and methods that can help you improve reading speed

73
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,710
You will find that they are achieving acceleration of this mechanical scanning

74
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,813
But ironically, it is the principle they have achieved

75
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:37,083
All are to help you save thinking

76
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,652
Just avoided the essence of reading

77
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,121
Let's take an audiobook as an example

78
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,657
My audience knows that I particularly like audiobooks

79
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,093
I use all my free time to listen to it

80
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,730
But audiobooks definitely cannot help me improve my reading speed

81
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,531
Why?

82
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,167
You, for example, say that I have been listening to this book recently, "The Creative Act."

83
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,036
I find it difficult to continue listening smoothly

84
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,873
Because this author's every sentence is filled with a lot of wisdom

85
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:04,444
I find that I often have to pause

86
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,778
Then take some time to think

87
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:09,248
Sometimes I even need to listen to it repeatedly

88
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:12,919
Operating this on an audiobook is actually quite a hassle

89
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,289
You don't even have to mention that you want to do something like taking notes

90
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,658
That means when listening to audiobooks

91
00:04:18,657 --> 00:04:20,225
You want to listen smoothly

92
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:24,330
You must restrict or bypass your thinking

93
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,433
Yes, I am able to finish listening to this book in one day

94
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,937
But reading without thinking is like sleepwalking

95
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,473
Then all I have is the illusion of speed

96
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,987
Does this mean that audiobooks are meaningless?

97
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,055
Of course, that's not it

98
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,324
Audiobooks are a very good supplement

99
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:55,561
For example, I often listen to it again after finishing reading a book

100
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,497
That can help me deepen the impression

101
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,066
Sometimes I will go and listen to audiobooks

102
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,167
I think this book is good

103
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,603
I will definitely go and read it again

104
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,172
Sometimes I will also listen and read at the same time

105
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,607
This can help me to focus

106
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,443
But absolutely do not help me improve my reading speed

107
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:14,681
Because I still have to pause, reflect repeatedly, and even take notes

108
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,883
So audiobooks are really great

109
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,951
But it can only serve as an assistant

110
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,720
Absolutely cannot replace you to read

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,490
And those so-called speed reading techniques actually make you skip thinking

112
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,993
For example, it will require you to read at a glance

113
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,095
Avoid making sounds in your mind

114
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,731
Let your finger trace this text as you read it downwards

115
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,232
Avoid reading repeatedly

116
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:37,136
This is even more treating reading as the work of a scanner

117
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,338
I do not recommend you to use any such methods

118
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,307
According to the same logic

119
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,811
Summarize those so-called dry goods, AI summaries

120
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:49,015
Or those videos of people summarizing books can be seen as a method to improve reading speed

121
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,950
Even use them as a substitute for reading

122
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,919
This is all self-deception

123
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,389
Yes, this also includes the book sharing videos I have made

124
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,325
This is because these so-called dry goods summaries

125
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,195
It is the result of the thinkers' summaries

126
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,731
However, the audience did not go through this thought process

127
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,400
That netizen's metaphor is particularly vivid

128
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,136
He said that thinking is like exercising muscles

129
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,039
Reading someone else's summary is like watching someone else exercise their muscles

130
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,774
This has nothing to do with myself

131
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,910
Some people might say

132
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,645
Why do we have to think when reading?

133
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,314
Can't I just get some information?

134
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,316
OK, you don't even need to go to school

135
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,852
You can solve problems by relying on search engines and AI

136
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,120
But you must be clear

137
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,722
The world is not lacking in information

138
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,859
But what is truly useful is often knowledge and wisdom

139
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,629
But the acquisition of these two things requires your thinking and experience

140
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,398
This is why some people

141
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,034
The reason for not being able to live a good life despite hearing many profound truths

142
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,537
You need to become the person who does the summary

143
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,539
And not the summarized consumer

144
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,810
Does this mean that all the summaries are meaningless again?

145
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,611
Of course not

146
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,514
Summary: It can be used as a screening and recommendation tool

147
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,251
But the premise is that you need to find summarizers who have similar interests as you

148
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,521
This is because all of us have preferences in our conclusions

149
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,890
We all base our interests on our own points

150
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,325
Summarize what you consider important

151
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,228
If your interests are not similar

152
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,397
You may miss out on the important content for you

153
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,966
Someone might say that I can use AI to summarize

154
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,036
Because it is fair, objective, and accurate

155
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:21,440
First of all, you said that AI is objective, but it is not objective

156
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,576
Whenever you ask ChatGPT sensitive questions

157
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:24,644
You just know why

158
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,114
Secondly, even if the summary of this AI is accurate

159
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:32,919
Its problem instead lies in its lack of preference

160
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,921
Because it doesn't know what you are interested in

161
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:39,158
It cannot summarize those that inspire you

162
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,893
Something that can stimulate your thinking

163
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,931
The summary of AI is even less valuable compared to humans

164
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,400
Moreover, it is not so accurate in summarizing now

165
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,335
If you have ever read something

166
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,137
Looking back at the conclusions made by AI

167
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,805
You will find it full of errors

168
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,774
Missed a lot of important things

169
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,844
So no matter what form of this summary

170
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,012
It can only serve as a reference

171
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,114
Absolutely cannot replace you reading

172
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,219
I believe you have understood by now

173
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,121
The speed of your thinking determines the speed of your reading

174
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:13,259
And vice versa, to accelerate the scanning process of your eyes and ears

175
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,695
Cannot force faster thinking

176
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,731
The only thing you force is the omission of thinking

177
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,767
To fundamentally improve your thinking speed while reading

178
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,336
I think there is only one way

179
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,136
That is

180
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,106
Prenez votre temps et augmentez votre temps de lecture

181
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,307
Take your time

182
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,910
It means to read at a pace that suits oneself

183
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,912
Do not deliberately force to increase speed

184
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:36,215
This can maximize the guarantee of your thinking and learning while reading

185
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:36,949
And

186
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:39,117
Take your time allows you to use those

187
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:41,319
The real way to improve your thinking through reading methods

188
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,723
You, for example, read notes and discuss with others

189
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,258
Even sharing and exporting

190
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,527
And increase your reading time

191
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,228
Just increase your reading time

192
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:49,996
Only in this way

193
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,698
Your thinking can only be exercised through this muscle

194
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,135
Your reading speed and quantity will naturally improve in the end

195
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,770
OK, I know that some people will also say

196
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,072
What I lack is precisely time

197
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,642
If you believe that reading and thinking are important

198
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,711
So, the lack of time for reading is a problem that you need to solve

199
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,880
Instead of making excuses for not reading

200
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,049
There is always a solution to every problem

201
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,451
But excuses are always endless

202
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,321
Someone said I can find time to read

203
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,522
But I lack focus

204
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,491
I can't control myself from looking at my phone

205
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,559
Actually, this is a common problem in modern society

206
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,297
In fact, only a few people can see the video here

207
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,533
Most people will turn off this video within the first 30 seconds

208
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,036
Of course, you can say that my video is poorly made

209
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,672
But if the standard for good content is

210
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,608
Allowing you to reach climax within the first 30 seconds

211
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:40,646
So most articles, long videos, movies, and books are not passing

212
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,683
Short videos and refreshing articles are activities that provide instant satisfaction

213
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,651
It only requires a very short attention from you

214
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:50,856
But reading is a behavior that requires you to spend time and effort in order to obtain dopamine

215
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,126
To become addicted to reading requires concentration

216
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:58,030
On the one hand, apart from spending time on slow-paced exercises

217
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,166
In addition to acquiring the ability of dopamine

218
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,770
On the other hand, choose books that can make you addicted to reading

219
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,871
Also very important

220
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,040
I specifically made a video like this a few years ago

221
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,375
Strongly recommend you to take a look

222
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,643
You will have many gains

223
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,713
OK, although we emphasize the pursuit of reading time

224
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:14,880
But never forget one thing

225
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,317
That is, you will get what you measure

226
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,886
When we use time as a standard

227
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,389
We might also go fishing

228
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,992
Go far away and slow down to think

229
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,995
So pursuing reading time is a very good method

230
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,429
But it is definitely not the goal

231
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,399
What is the true goal of our reading?

232
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,635
If reading is said to be the essence of thinking,

233
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:39,271
So change should be its ultimate goal

234
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:43,109
In reading and contemplating, you may gain inspiration and empathy

235
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,443
Generate new problems

236
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,078
Attain enlightenment and integrate comprehensively

237
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,248
And what ultimately makes all of this meaningful is change

238
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,150
This change can be a mental one

239
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,318
It can also be in terms of action

240
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,287
If you say that kind of reading method that pursues speed and quantity

241
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,056
It has regarded reading as an act

242
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,858
The working of a scanner

243
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:02,361
So we go after the ultimate result of change

244
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:06,198
It is likening reading to the training of AI models

245
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,834
Because in the current AI language (neural network) model training

246
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,668
There is a characteristic

247
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:12,638
That is, they are through the final result

248
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:17,643
Adjust its weight and training methods in reverse

249
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,612
That's the same when it comes to studying

250
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,548
If you ultimately did not achieve this change

251
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:23,682
No thinking obtained

252
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,419
So you need to adjust your reading method

253
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,553
Your reading speed

254
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,488
Even you need to go and exchange a book

255
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,692
This is faster than pursuing how much you have read

256
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,161
Even how much time was spent is more meaningful

257
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,996
When you can comprehend every book you finish reading

258
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,631
When it feels like becoming a different person

259
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,367
So you have truly achieved the goal of reading

260
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,735
Mastered the correct method

261
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,969
Read the right book

262
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,072
This is what is called "reading changes destiny."

263
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:51,243
That's why we say that reading is actually a shortcut to success

264
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,045
But there is no shortcut to reading itself

265
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,480
You have no way to save time

266
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,682
Why am I at my own book club?

267
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,518
Strongly oppose that kind of dry goods summary

268
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,287
Others take you to study

269
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,190
My members need to study hard

270
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,458
To spend time

271
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,394
Our philosophy is to harness the power of community

272
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,795
To promote reading among everyone

273
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,698
Deepen your thinking through sharing

274
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,767
Finally achieve your change

275
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,335
If you also agree with this concept

276
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,870
Welcome to join our book club

277
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,538
Okay, see you in the next video

278
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:20,172
Bye bye`;

what's up guys Terrace cousin here back
00:00:02 :
with another tutorial in this one we're
00:00:04 :
going to take a look at use ref a very
00:00:06 :
powerful hook that is used whenever you
00:00:08 :
want to reference a value that is not
00:00:10 :
needed for rendering make sure to watch
00:00:12 :
until the end of the video because I'm
00:00:14 :
really going to be covering everything
00:00:15 :
there is to know about userf and also
00:00:18 :
some very important points that if you
00:00:20 :
do watch until the end I can promise you
00:00:22 :
that you're most likely not going to
00:00:24 :
have to need to watch another video on
00:00:26 :
use ref ever again sound good cool let's
00:00:30 :
jump on my computer screen and talk
00:00:31 :
about use ref cool so use ref honestly
00:00:35 :
I've thought about this quite a while
00:00:37 :
and I think the best way and the
00:00:39 :
simplest way to really think about this
00:00:40 :
is think about ref as state something
00:00:43 :
similar to state in the sense that you
00:00:45 :
can hold and mutate values that are used
00:00:48 :
in your component but the main
00:00:50 :
difference is that unlike State ref does
00:00:53 :
not trigger a re-render of the component
00:00:55 :
and ref values are not used in the
00:00:59 :
return body of the actual component it's
00:01:02 :
not used for something that you're
00:01:04 :
rendering it's a hook that is used for
00:01:06 :
values that are not needed for rendering
00:01:08 :
so the best way for us to really
00:01:10 :
understand this is to look at the simple
00:01:12 :
example that I have here and compare
00:01:14 :
state to ref and see how they both
00:01:16 :
behave and see the differences between
00:01:18 :
the two so this application here as you
00:01:21 :
can see is really simple it has a count
00:01:23 :
from state right a discount variable
00:01:25 :
here uses use state it is initialized to
00:01:28 :
zero we have the set count of data
00:01:30 :
function to update it and by the way if
00:01:32 :
you're not familiar with ustate I have a
00:01:34 :
whole video about that it's in the same
00:01:35 :
playlist that you're watching this video
00:01:37 :
now so if you're unfamiliar you want to
00:01:39 :
learn more about your state make sure to
00:01:40 :
go check out that video first then we
00:01:43 :
have another count but this one through
00:01:46 :
use ref and this one as well is
00:01:48 :
initialized with a value of zero then we
00:01:50 :
have this handle increment function
00:01:52 :
which is attached to this button right
00:01:54 :
here and when clicked it will first set
00:01:56 :
the count to count plus one so update
00:01:59 :
this State count to count plus 1
00:02:02 :
incremented by one and then it will do
00:02:05 :
the same thing to the ref it will
00:02:07 :
increment the ref by one now this dot
00:02:10 :
current thing here is actually how you
00:02:13 :
access values and how you mutate values
00:02:15 :
in your ref the value of a ref is always
00:02:18 :
going to be inside of this dot current
00:02:20 :
property whatever the value is in our
00:02:22 :
case it's zero it's a number if it was
00:02:24 :
an input if it was anything else you
00:02:26 :
would always access and mutate it with
00:02:28 :
the dot current property so this line
00:02:30 :
here 11 is just taking the value and
00:02:33 :
it's doing plus plus which is Javascript
00:02:35 :
notation for incremented by one so these
00:02:38 :
two lines are doing the same thing just
00:02:40 :
for both pieces of not state but both
00:02:43 :
counts essentially
00:02:45 :
and then we are logging the state count
00:02:48 :
and we are logging the ref count right
00:02:52 :
so let's see what happens if I do this
00:02:54 :
if I open up the console
00:02:56 :
and then clear everything what will
00:02:58 :
happen when I press increment so I press
00:03:00 :
increment and first of all the count has
00:03:03 :
been updated to one because the count
00:03:05 :
here is used in this return function and
00:03:07 :
it's displayed here this is the count
00:03:09 :
from the state so the state count we
00:03:11 :
know that is now 1 as a result of me
00:03:14 :
pressing this increment button if we
00:03:16 :
look here at the console we're going to
00:03:18 :
see that state logged as 0 and ref
00:03:21 :
locked as one now this is very
00:03:24 :
interesting and I want you to pay
00:03:26 :
attention because this is really
00:03:28 :
important that you understand why State
00:03:30 :
logged is zero and why ref log this one
00:03:33 :
so looking at this function here let's
00:03:36 :
first talk about the state right we are
00:03:38 :
incrementing the state and then we are
00:03:40 :
console logging the state after it has
00:03:42 :
been incremented just like I talked
00:03:45 :
about in the video that I did on you
00:03:46 :
State State updates one particular
00:03:49 :
property that they have is that they
00:03:51 :
happen and they trigger a new render a
00:03:54 :
new render of the component and the
00:03:56 :
updated value is only accessible in that
00:03:59 :
new render so what react is going to do
00:04:02 :
when we do this set count count plus one
00:04:04 :
is it's going to update the state of
00:04:06 :
count to count plus one it's going to
00:04:09 :
then continue running the body of the
00:04:11 :
function running any other hooks or
00:04:13 :
anything else that we might have in this
00:04:15 :
component right it doesn't stop
00:04:18 :
rendering altogether just because we're
00:04:20 :
updating the state it's going to
00:04:21 :
continue to finish the work and then
00:04:23 :
once all of the work has been done it's
00:04:25 :
going to then trigger a re-render
00:04:28 :
and that we render is going to have
00:04:30 :
access to the new value which is how
00:04:33 :
we're seeing it here on the screen right
00:04:35 :
this is because the component has
00:04:37 :
re-rendered since we press this
00:04:38 :
increment button and in that next render
00:04:41 :
we have access to the new updated value
00:04:44 :
which is one however this console log
00:04:48 :
here is not running in the next render
00:04:51 :
it's still running in that first initial
00:04:53 :
render when we click the button so when
00:04:56 :
even though we did set count here that
00:04:58 :
value as we said is only accessible in
00:05:01 :
the next render and so this console log
00:05:04 :
here is going to reference the old value
00:05:06 :
which was zero right that is how you
00:05:08 :
state Works only in the next render
00:05:11 :
which in our case only when we press
00:05:13 :
this increment button again will we then
00:05:15 :
have access to the new value of that
00:05:17 :
previous render so if I do this
00:05:19 :
you see that now we have access to State
00:05:22 :
one right that was the updated value of
00:05:25 :
the previous render however as you can
00:05:27 :
see now we're at count two right we're
00:05:30 :
always lacking behind one render that is
00:05:33 :
okay that is normal that is how you
00:05:35 :
state works right but now if you look at
00:05:38 :
ref it's different ref right logged one
00:05:43 :
right off the bat and then I press the
00:05:45 :
button again and it logged two right off
00:05:48 :
the bat so it functions very differently
00:05:50 :
than you state and that's okay that's
00:05:52 :
expected
00:05:53 :
ref will allow you to make updates and
00:05:57 :
to read the updated value instantly
00:06:00 :
without waiting for a re-render and the
00:06:03 :
reason you don't wait for a re-render is
00:06:05 :
because use ref doesn't even trigger a
00:06:08 :
new re-render in the first place that's
00:06:10 :
not what it's for if you need a new
00:06:12 :
re-render then you have to use state if
00:06:15 :
you don't then you use use ref that is
00:06:17 :
what I meant in the beginning of the
00:06:19 :
video when I said that use ref is a hook
00:06:21 :
that is used for Value that is not
00:06:23 :
needed for rendering that is how we're
00:06:26 :
able to have access to this new value
00:06:27 :
right away so when you increment the
00:06:30 :
count of the ref here you can console
00:06:33 :
log it right away and get access to the
00:06:35 :
new value right away that is a property
00:06:37 :
of ref of use ref now let me drive your
00:06:40 :
attention to what happens if instead of
00:06:42 :
discount here instead of the state count
00:06:44 :
in our return function what happens if I
00:06:47 :
replace this with the ref so I'll do
00:06:50 :
ref.current counterf.current and then in
00:06:53 :
the increment function I'm just going to
00:06:55 :
get rid of anything about State because
00:06:58 :
I don't want to trigger a re-render
00:07:00 :
through state right I only want to
00:07:02 :
manipulate the ref and see how our
00:07:04 :
component behaves now so I'm just going
00:07:06 :
to refresh so we have a clean slate and
00:07:08 :
if I press increment the count stayed at
00:07:12 :
0 but the ref logged as one I press
00:07:16 :
increment again the count still stays at
00:07:18 :
zero but the ref locked at 2 right this
00:07:22 :
is interesting but by now hopefully it
00:07:25 :
should make sense refs do not cause a
00:07:28 :
component to re-render and so if you
00:07:31 :
were to use it inside of this return
00:07:32 :
function you would not get the updated
00:07:35 :
value because that does not trigger a
00:07:38 :
component to re-render you would only
00:07:40 :
get the updated value if you have
00:07:42 :
something else that triggers the
00:07:44 :
component to re-render for example if we
00:07:46 :
re-added the set count here and then
00:07:49 :
just refreshed we would increment again
00:07:52 :
and now we would see ref1 and count one
00:07:55 :
increment again ref2 and count two we're
00:07:58 :
getting the most up-to-date value but
00:08:00 :
not because of ref we're getting it
00:08:02 :
because of State because of this set
00:08:04 :
count here that is what is causing the
00:08:06 :
component to re-render to trigger a
00:08:08 :
re-render so that we get access to the
00:08:10 :
most up-to-date value and so that's what
00:08:13 :
I meant that you should never use ref
00:08:14 :
inside of this return function because
00:08:17 :
your application is not going to work as
00:08:19 :
expected and you're going to use ref for
00:08:22 :
something that is not intended to be
00:08:23 :
used for and now let's talk about
00:08:25 :
another use case of ref one that you
00:08:27 :
might be more familiar with which is
00:08:29 :
using it with input elements or any
00:08:31 :
other HTML element in this case I just
00:08:34 :
have a simple ref which can be of type
00:08:36 :
HTML input element or null and then we
00:08:39 :
are passing it here to this input
00:08:41 :
element inside of the return function so
00:08:44 :
this is fine right we're not using dot
00:08:46 :
current here we're just passing the
00:08:48 :
reference of the ref to this input
00:08:49 :
opponent and this is allowed this is one
00:08:52 :
of the only use cases where you can use
00:08:54 :
a ref directly in the return function
00:08:56 :
and the reason you do this is because if
00:08:58 :
you do that react is going to handle
00:09:01 :
setting the dot current property of the
00:09:04 :
ref to the input as long as it's mounted
00:09:06 :
right the moment that the input becomes
00:09:09 :
unmounted whether the component unmounts
00:09:10 :
or some other reason react is going to
00:09:13 :
automatically handle removing the dot
00:09:16 :
current from The Ref right so you get
00:09:17 :
that benefit if you do it this way and
00:09:20 :
doing it this way right you have a ref
00:09:22 :
you pass it here to the input you can
00:09:24 :
then access some of the functions from
00:09:27 :
that input like for example this Focus
00:09:29 :
function right here this use effect what
00:09:31 :
we'll do is when the component is
00:09:33 :
mounted and everything else is rendered
00:09:34 :
because hooks always run after things
00:09:36 :
are rendered this input ref will be set
00:09:39 :
by react automatically to this input and
00:09:42 :
then you can call input ref.current
00:09:44 :
question mark right because we've
00:09:46 :
defined it as a type that it can't be
00:09:48 :
null right so typescript does doesn't
00:09:50 :
know that react will automatically
00:09:51 :
handle this for us but you can call the
00:09:54 :
focus function on this input on Mount
00:09:57 :
right which is going to focus here if I
00:09:59 :
just refresh the page it's going to
00:10:01 :
automatically Focus the input on month
00:10:03 :
which is a very useful thing to have in
00:10:05 :
an application perhaps you have a form
00:10:07 :
right and you want to facilitate the
00:10:08 :
user experience by having the first
00:10:10 :
input that makes sense be automatically
00:10:12 :
focused on mobile that's also going to
00:10:14 :
trigger the keyboard right this is a
00:10:16 :
feature that you would want you would
00:10:17 :
have to use a ref to accomplish that
00:10:19 :
feature so refs beside using values that
00:10:22 :
are not needed for rendering are also
00:10:24 :
useful if you want to access directly
00:10:26 :
HTML Dom elements and call functions on
00:10:29 :
those elements you can also use it
00:10:31 :
perhaps you've used it as well with
00:10:33 :
third-party libraries that create a ref
00:10:35 :
and then expose that ref along with some
00:10:37 :
functions so that you can access from
00:10:39 :
anywhere the functions of inside of that
00:10:42 :
component that is also a use case for
00:10:44 :
ref although that's not usually one that
00:10:46 :
you would write yourself you would just
00:10:47 :
more generally create a ref and pass it
00:10:49 :
and then by the documentation to Sweet
00:10:51 :
of the different functions that you can
00:10:53 :
call and work on it that way still refs
00:10:56 :
are a very powerful feature in react and
00:10:58 :
you really have to spend the time to
00:11:00 :
understand how they work what they're
00:11:02 :
used for what's the difference between
00:11:03 :
ref and state and how you can use it
00:11:05 :
with elements and also in third-party
00:11:08 :
libraries please take the time to really
00:11:10 :
focus and pun intended right Focus
00:11:13 :
really focus and understand what ref is
00:11:16 :
and how to use it and you will be a much
00:11:17 :
better react developer cool so there you
00:11:20 :
go another tutorial in the books this
00:11:22 :
was used buff I really hope that now you
00:11:24 :
have a better understanding of this hook
00:11:25 :
and how to use it and you can now go and
00:11:28 :
work on it in your own applications try
00:11:30 :
it out try the difference between that
00:11:31 :
and state and like I said you will
00:11:33 :
become a much better developer spend all
00:11:35 :
the time that you need and that is
00:11:37 :
required to really properly understand
00:11:40 :
this if you've enjoyed this video if you
00:11:42 :
got any value from it whatsoever please
00:11:44 :
do make sure to leave a subscribe leave
00:11:46 :

this also if you want to learn more
00:11:59 :
about react and just be part of a

community of react developers and also
00:12:04 :
have access to me to answer your
00:12:06 :
questions look at your code help you
00:12:08 :
become a better developer I've created a

I'm there every day answering questions
00:12:22 :
reviewing code and I'm trying to create
00:12:24 :
the best community of react developers
00:12:26 :

### Summary
The video is a tutorial on the use of the useRef hook in React, explaining its purpose in storing and mutating values that do not trigger re-renders in components.

### Analogy
Using useRef is like having a notepad to write down information that you want to reference quickly without needing to redraw the entire picture.

https://www.youtube.com/

### Notes
- 💡 useRef is used for storing values that do not trigger component re-renders.
- 💡 State in React triggers re-renders, while useRef does not.
- 💡 useRef is useful for accessing and manipulating DOM elements directly.

### Keywords
- **useRef**: A React hook used for storing mutable values that do not trigger re-renders.
- **re-render**: The process of updating and refreshing the component's UI based on changes in state or props.

### Complex Words
- **useRef**: A built-in React hook used for storing values that do not trigger re-renders.
- **incremented**: To increase or add to a value.
- **re-render**: The process of updating and refreshing the component's appearance based on changes in state or props.

00:00-04:59: 大家好，这里是最佳拍档，我是大飞 我们做了很多期关于大模型的内容了 但是不论是检索增强生成RAG 还是代理Agent 几乎每个大语言模型驱动的应用程序 都可能会用到向量数据库 那么，究竟什么是向量数据库 它与传统数据库有何不同 我们又该如何选择向量数据库呢？ 今天我们就来聊聊这个话题 为了方便大家的理解 整个内容并没有晦涩的术语或者复杂的数学公式 大飞我希望尽量能够做到雅俗共赏 在讲向量数据库之前 我们首先需要理解什么是向量？ 应该说 向量是基于不同特征或者属性 来描述一个对象的数据表示 每个向量代表一个单独的数据点 例如一个词或者一张图片 由描述其许多特性的值的集合组成 这些变量有时也被称为“特征”或“维度”。 例如 一张图片可以表示为像素值的向量 整个句子也可以表示为单词嵌入的向量 一些常用的数据向量包括 1、图像向量 这是通过深度学习模型提取的图像特征向量 这些特征向量捕捉了图像的重要信息 如颜色、形状、纹理等 可以用于图像识别、检索等任务 2、文本向量 这是通过词嵌入技术如Word2Vec、BERT等生成的文本特征向量 这些向量包含了文本的语义信息 可以用于文本分类、情感分析等任务 3、语音向量 这是通过声学模型从声音信号中提取的特征向量 这些向量捕捉了声音的重要特性 如音调、节奏、音色等 可以用于语音识别、声纹识别等任务 而向量数据库就是一种将数据存储为高维向量的数据库 高维向量是特征或者属性的数学表示 每个向量都有一定数量的维度 根据数据的复杂性和粒度 维度可以从几十到几千不等 向量通常是通过对原始数据 比如文本、图像、音频、视频等等 应用某种变换或嵌入函数来生成的 嵌入函数可以基于各种方法 比如机器学习模型、单词嵌入、特征提取算法 向量数据库会采用索引策略 来简化向量相似的特定查询 这在机器学习应用程序中特别有用 因为相似性搜索经常用来发现可以比较的数据点 或者生成建议 向量数据库的主要功能包括三点 管理、存储和检索 向量数据库以原始数据形式处理数据 能够有效地组织和管理数据 便于AI模型应用 而且它能够存储向量数据 包括各种AI模型需要使用到的高维数据 此外 向量数据库特别擅长高效地检索数据 这个特点能够确保AI模型在需要的时候 快速获得所需要的数据 这也是向量数据库能够在一些推荐系统 或者检索系统中得到应用的重要原因 向量数据库的主要优点是 它允许基于数据的向量距离或者相似性 来进行快速准确的相似性搜索和检索 这意味着，可以使用向量数据库 根据语义或上下文含义 查找最相似或最相关的数据 而不是使用基于精确匹配或者预定义标准的查询数据库的传统方法 向量数据库可以搜索非结构化数据 但是也可以处理半结构化甚至结构化数据 例如，可以使用向量数据库 根据视觉内容和风格查找与给定图像相似的图像 或者根据主题和情感查找与给定文档相似的文档 以及根据功能和评级查找与给定产品相似的产品 接下来 我们说说向量数据库的工作机理 我们已经知道 向量数据库的构建是为了适应向量嵌入的特定结构 并且它们使用索引算法 根据向量与查询向量的相似性 来有效地搜索和检索向量 向量数据库的工作原理 我们可以通过CPU和GPU的工作原理进行类比 CPU和GPU分别是计算机的运算和图形处理核心 而向量数据库则是大模型的记忆和存储核心 在大模型学习阶段 向量数据库会接收多模态数据进行向量化表示 让大模型在训练时能够更高效地调用和处理数据 区别于传统数据库 向量数据库主要有三点不同 数据向量化，向量检索和相似度计算 数据的向量化采用embedding技术 嵌入作为一个桥梁 将非数字数据转换为机器学习模型可以使用的形式
05:00-09:59: 使它们能够更有效地识别数据中的模式和关系 一般来说，文本是一维向量 图像是二维矩阵 视频相当于三维矩阵 这些嵌入实质上是存储数据的上下文表示的数字列表 在存储层内 数据库以m个向量堆栈的形式存储 每个向量使用n个维度表示一个数据点 总大小为m×n 为了查询性能的原因 这些堆栈通常通过分片的方式进行划分 向量检索是指输入一个向量 从数据库中查找与输入向量最相似的topN个向量返回 要在向量数据库中执行相似性搜索和检索 需要使用表示所需信息或条件的查询向量 查询向量可以从与存储向量相同类型的数据导出 或者从不同类型的数据导出 使用相似性度量来计算两个向量在向量空间中的距离 相似性度量可以基于各种度量 比如余弦相似性、欧氏距离、向量内积 hamming距离、jaccard指数 其中 向量检索算法是向量数据库的核心之一 向量检索可以看为是近似最近邻搜索 通过预先的索引构建来减小数据查询时的搜索空间 加快检索速度 目前主要的检索算法有几种 包括基于树的方法 例如KDTree和Annoy 基于图的方法，例如HNSW 基于乘积量化的方法 例如SQ和PQ，基于哈希的方法 例如LSH，以及基于倒排索引的方法 向量数据库中的索引可以按照数据结构和压缩级别两个层次进行组织实现 根据数据结构建立的索引 可以分为基于哈希、基于树、基于图和基于倒排文件的几种 而根据数据压缩方式建立索引 主要包括平坦压缩和量化压缩 平坦压缩是指以未经修改的形式存储向量的索引 量化中索引的底层向量 通常通过将浮点数转换为整数的方式 被分解成由较少字节组成的块 从而减少内存消耗和搜索过程中的计算成本 相似性搜索和检索的结果 通常是与查询向量具有最高相似性得分的向量的排序列表 然后 你可以访问与原始源或索引中的每个向量 相关联的相应原始数据 接下来 我们再介绍一下目前向量数据库都有哪些种类 市面上都有哪些向量数据库 以及它们之间的一些差异点 根据向量数据库的的实现方式 我们可以将向量数据库大致分为4类 分别是原生的向量数据库、支持向量的全文检索数据库、支持向量的NoSQL数据库 以及支持向量的关系型数据库 先说第一类原生的向量数据库 这些数据库是专门为存储和检索向量而设计的 包括Chroma, LanceDB, Marqo Milvus，也就是Zilliz, Pinecone Qdrant Vald, Vespa, Weaviate等等 它们所管理的数据是基于对象或数据点的向量表示 进行组织和索引 我们今天只介绍其中的三种 其他数据库的具体信息可以参考各自的官网 第一个是Faiss，严格来说 Faiss只是一个用于高效相似性搜索和密集向量聚类的开源库 Faiss是用C++编写的 带有完整的Python/numpy包装器 一些常用算法都有GPU实现 成为了很多开源向量数据库的基础 Faiss能够构建不同的索引类型 并提供了欧式距离或者点积的相似度计算功能 有些索引类型是简单的基线 比如精确搜索 大多数可用的索引结构需要考虑搜索时间 搜索质量 每个索引向量使用的内存等等 Faiss支持多种向量搜索技术 提供了能够在不同大小的向量集中搜索的算法 甚至可以处理那些超过内存容量的向量集 Faiss的主要优势之一是速度和可扩展性 即使在具有数十亿个向量的数据集中也可以进行快速搜索 此外 Faiss还提供了用于评估和调整参数的辅助代码 第二个是Pinecone Pinecone是一个基于云的向量数据库 可以开发实时相似性搜索应用 能够以毫秒级的延迟存储和探索高维向量嵌入 适用于推荐系统、图片和视频搜索以及自然语言处理等应用 Pinecone的主要功能包括自动索引、实时更新、查询自动调整和用于与当前流程进行简单交互的REST API 它的架构专为可扩展性和稳健性而构建 可以轻松管理海量数据 同时保持高可用性 Pinecone是一个可以托管的向量数据库平台 也就是说有商用方案 也有免费使用方案 它的主要特点包括 支持全托管服务、高度可伸缩、实时数据摄取、低延迟的搜索、以及与LangChain集成
10:00-14:59: Pinecone采用了多种安全措施来保护用户的数据安全和隐私 包括多层次的访问控制机制可以控制用户的访问权限和操作权限 同时采用了数据加密、传输加密等技术来保护数据的安全性 还提供了数据备份和恢复等功能 可以防止数据丢失和损坏 Pinecone在性能方面表现非常出色 它能够支持高达1百万次的QPS 且具有低延迟和高吞吐量的特点 还具有分布式部署、实时索引构建和高效的向量相似度搜索等优点 可以帮助用户快速处理大规模的向量数据 此外 Pinecone还支持多种编程语言和框架 比如Python、Java、TensorFlow 等 使得用户可以轻松地将其集成到自己的应用程序中 第三个是Milvus Milvus是一个开源的分布式向量数据库 它具备高可用、高性能、易拓展的特点 用于海量向量数据的实时召回 Milvus 基于 Faiss、Annoy、HNSW 等向量搜索库构建 可以轻松管理数百万个实体 可以根据不同的数据特点选择最合适的索引算法 核心是解决稠密向量相似度检索的问题 在向量检索的基础上 Milvus支持数据分区分片、数据持久化、增量数据摄取、标量向量混合查询、time travel 等功能 同时大幅优化了向量检索的性能 可满足任何向量检索场景的应用需求 此外 Milvus还具有分布式部署、高可用性和高扩展性等优点 可以帮助用户快速处理海量的向量数据 它也提供了多种安全措施来保护用户的数据安全和隐私 支持 SSL/TLS 加密和访问控制等技术 可以防止数据被非法访问和窃取 还提供了数据备份和恢复等功能 可以保护数据的完整性和可用性 在客户端方面 Milvus还提供了多种语言的SDK 例如Python、Java、C++等 使得用户可以方便地使用不同的编程语言来访问和操作Milvus 第二类是支持向量的全文检索数据库 这类数据库包括Elastic/Lucene、OpenSearch和Solr 它们都具有丰富的文本检索功能 比如可定制的标记器 分词器，停用词列表和N-grams等等 大部分都基于开源库 并且有大型集成的生态系统 包括了向量库 例如 Elasticsearch是一个支持各种类型数据的分布式搜索和分析引擎 Elasticsearch在7.3版本中 添加了对向量数据索引的支持 支持混合查询 但是向量检索采用的仍然是暴力计算 性能损耗较大 在8.0版本引入了knn search 其实就是一种近似最近邻搜索算法 相似度支持欧式距离 点积和余弦相似性 knn search底层其实使用的是HNSW 不过遗憾的是 这种方式无法进行混合检索 第三类是支持向量的NoSQL数据库 几乎所有这些NoSQL数据库 都是最近才通过添加向量搜索扩展而具备向量能力的 所以如果要是使用的话一定要做好测试 Cassandra，Rockset Azure Cosmos DB和MongoDB等都纷纷宣布了增加向量搜索的计划 NoSQL数据库的向量搜索性能可能差别很大 这取决于所支持的向量函数、索引方法和硬件加速 对于支持向量的NoSQL 数据库 探索尝试未尝不可 但在生产环境中使用要慎之又慎 第四类是支持向量的SQL数据库 这些大都数都是关系型数据库 并且支持sql查询 例如SingleStoreDB, PostgreSQL Clickhouse和Kinetica的pgvector/Supabase Vector等等 它们都宣布包含了向量搜索功能 比如点积 余弦相似度 欧几里得距离和曼哈顿距离 并且使用相似度分数找到n个最近邻 由于提供了混合查询 可以将向量与其他数据结合起来 从而获得更有意义的结果 另外 大多数SQL数据库都可以作为服务部署 可以在云上进行完全的管理 例如 Postgres通过pg_vector和pg_embdding两个插件来实现向量数据库 让PG数据库支持了向量索引检索的能力 它的索引算法使用的是基于Faiss的IVF Flat索引 提供了优异的召回率 我们再简单对这些向量数据库做一些对比 首先是编程语言支持方面 Chroma目前提供了Python和TypeScript的包装器 而基于C++编程语言的有OLAP数据库Clickhouse 以及开源向量索引HNSWLib 不过如今呢 一些新的数据库通常都会使用更加现代的编程语言 比如说Golang或者是Rust来编写 比如Pinecone就是用Rust重写过 目前呢只有Vespa是用Java来构建 其次呢是开源方面 Pinecone是完全闭源的 而Zilliz也是一个闭源的
15:00-19:59: 完全托管的商业解决方案 但是它是完全建立在Milvus之上 而Milvus是开源的 其他的向量数据库呢 至少在代码库的方面 基本上都是源代码可用的 不过呢 还要看一下具体的许可证 这决定了代码的可许可性以及如何去部署 在检索算法方面 许多向量数据库的检索算法都采用了HNSW 其中Milvus的检索算法支持得最为丰富 大家可以暂停观看一下 最后呢在部署方式上 向量数据库的典型部署方式 包括本地部署和托管云原生的方式 二者呢都遵循CS架构 还有一种新的选择呢是嵌入式的模式 其中数据库本身与应用程序的代码是紧密结合的 以severless的方式运行 目前呢只有Chroma和LanceDB可以用作嵌入式的数据库 综上所述 有网友已经贴心的总结了 主流的向量数据库的部分指标的对比 此外呢在选择向量数据库的时候 还需要特别考虑几个因素 分别是第一点可扩展性 它是否能够高效的处理高维度的大数据量 而且能够根据数据需求的增长进行扩展 第二点性能 速度和效率对数据库至关重要 需要在数据搜索、搜索性能 和执行各种向量操作方面表现出色 第三点灵活性 需要支持广泛的数据类型和格式 并且可以轻松地适应不同的应用场景 第四点易用性 数据库是否易于使用和管理 易于安装和配置 具有直观的API 并且有良好的文档和支持 第五点可靠性 需要有可靠和稳定的声誉 那对比完主流的向量数据库之后 我们看一看与其他类型的数据库对比它们是怎么样 那传统数据库呢 比如说关系数据库 它们的目的是存储结构化的数据 这就意味着数据会被组织到一个预定义的表、行或者列中 从而可以确定数据的完整性和一致性 传统数据库呢往往会针对于CRUD的操作进行优化 目的是高效的创建读取、更新和删除数据的条目 让它能够适用于从Web服务到企业软件的各种应用程序 但是一旦定义了数据库的结构 进行更改的时候可能就会非常的复杂 而且耗时 这种刚性可以确保数据的一致性 但是灵活性可能不如一些的现代数据库的无模式 或者是动态模式的特性 我大概总结了一下它们之间的区别放到这里 此外呢 在与行和列中存储多种标准数据类型 比如说字符串、数字或者其他标量数据类型的方式不同 向量数据库引入了向量这种新的数据类型 并且围绕这种数据类型来构建和优化 专门用来实现快速的存储检索和最近邻搜索语义 而在传统数据库中则是使用 查找完全匹配项的索引或者是键值对 对数据库中的行进行查询 并且返回这些查询的相关行 在与图数据库的对比方面 向量数据库在信息提取 信息索引和信息检索方面有很大区别 我们今天呢就暂时不多说了 有时间呢再专门去介绍 在最后呢 我想简单介绍一下 向量数据库在大语言模型中的应用 基于大语言模型的应用经常会面临一些挑战 比如说生成不准确或者是不相关的信息 缺乏事实的一致性或者是常识 重复或者是自相矛盾 以及存在偏见或者是令人反感等等 那为了克服这些挑战 可以使用向量数据库来存储与所需的领域的 不同主题、关键词、事实、观点以及来源的信息 然后呢在使用大语言模型的时候 通过AI插件从向量数据库中传递信息 从而生成更具有信息性和吸引力的内容 来符合用户的目标意图和指定的风格 那借助于向量数据库 我们能够快速的加载和存储事件作为嵌入 将向量数据库作为指挥大语言模型的手段 提供上下文信息、长期记忆 检索语义上的数据关联等等这些功能 向量数据库的典型使用一般包括这样几步啊 第一步呢 是使用embeding技术来创建向量 第二步呢 是将这些向量存储到向量数据库中 第三步呢 就是应用一些索引的策略来组织管理向量 第四步呢 是使用查询向量来执行相似性的搜索 第五步呢 是从向量数据库中取得相似的向量 实际上呢 向量数据库在自然语言处理 计算机视觉、推荐系统 以及其他需要对数据进行语义理解和匹配的领域呢 都有很多的应用 而在向量数据库中存储信息 能够让大语言模型生成更加相关 更加连贯的文本 由于向量数据库将要查询的数据存储为嵌入向量 并且大语言模型也是将它内部的知识编码为嵌入向量 因此呢在生成式的问答应用中是天生的一对 向量数据库可以充当知识库的功能 而大语言模型可以直接在嵌入空间中去查询数据的子集 所以一般的使用啊是这样的 首先呢 用户通过界面用自然语言提出问题 问题的文本呢会被传递给嵌入模型 然后返回一个句子的嵌入向量 随后呢 问题的向量会被传递给向量数据库
20:00-24:59: 通过ANN搜索返回与之最相似的前k个结果 这一步呢非常关键 因为它大大缩小了大语言模型在下一步中的搜索空间 接下来呢 基于开发者预定义的模板去构建一个大语言模型的提示 将它呢转化成为嵌入向量并传递给大语言模型 大语言模型呢在前k个结构中去搜索信息 并且生成问题的答案 再把这个答案呢发送给用户 不过呢 向量数据库也有一些潜在的限制 比方说在搜索应用中 他们不一定会优先考虑关键词短语的精准匹配 来确定相关性 而且呢存储和查询的数据必须适应 所使用的嵌入模型的最大序列长度 比如说在类似于BERT的模型中 这个长度呢一般不会超过几百个词 目前呢最好的方法是利用像LangChain 以及像LlamaIndex这样的框架 将数据分块 或者是压缩成适合底层模型上下文的固定大小的向量 同样呢向量数据库也面临着许多 与其他数据库技术相同的一些挑战 比如说提高可扩展性、近似精度、延迟性能和经济性 许多向量数据库在核心的数据库能力方面都还需要提升 比如说像安全性、弹性、运营支持和工作负载支持的多样化 随着AI应用的成熟 未来对向量数据库的需要 一定不会仅仅只限于向量搜索的功能 好了本期的视频内容就到这里 感谢大家的观看 我们下期再见`
