00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,960
营销策划

8
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,960
我基本上都要去咨询ChatGPT的意见

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,840
而且几乎没有例外的

10
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,719
每一次我都能够得到比较满意的回答

00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:21,120
而且总是能够获得一些新的启发或者点子

12
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,400
所以当我知道这个ChatGPT4

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,520
不仅可以上网

14
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,160
而且还可以和第三方的一些软件

15
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,760
进行相连接的时候

16
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,639
我基本上是毫不犹豫的就立马下单

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,560
目前经过了几个周的测试

19
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,639
我可以非常自信的告诉大家

20
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:39,480
这个钱花的值

what's up guys Terrace cousin here back
00:00:02 :
with another tutorial in this one we're
00:00:04 :
going to take a look at use ref a very
00:00:06 :
powerful hook that is used whenever you
00:00:08 :
want to reference a value that is not
00:00:10 :
needed for rendering make sure to watch
00:00:12 :
until the end of the video because I'm
00:00:14 :
really going to be covering everything
00:00:15 :
there is to know about userf and also
00:00:18 :
some very important points that if you
00:00:20 :
do watch until the end I can promise you
00:00:22 :
that you're most likely not going to
00:00:24 :
have to need to watch another video on
00:00:26 :
use ref ever again sound good cool let's
00:00:30 :
jump on my computer screen and talk
00:00:31 :
about use ref cool so use ref honestly
00:00:35 :
I've thought about this quite a while
00:00:37 :
and I think the best way and the
00:00:39 :
simplest way to really think about this
00:00:40 :
is think about ref as state something
00:00:43 :
similar to state in the sense that you
00:00:45 :
can hold and mutate values that are used
00:00:48 :
in your component but the main
00:00:50 :
difference is that unlike State ref does
00:00:53 :
not trigger a re-render of the component
00:00:55 :
and ref values are not used in the
00:00:59 :
return body of the actual component it's
00:01:02 :
not used for something that you're
00:01:04 :
rendering it's a hook that is used for
00:01:06 :
values that are not needed for rendering
00:01:08 :
so the best way for us to really
00:01:10 :
understand this is to look at the simple
00:01:12 :
example that I have here and compare
00:01:14 :
state to ref and see how they both
00:01:16 :
behave and see the differences between
00:01:18 :
the two so this application here as you
00:01:21 :
can see is really simple it has a count
00:01:23 :
from state right a discount variable
00:01:25 :
here uses use state it is initialized to
00:01:28 :
zero we have the set count of data
00:01:30 :
function to update it and by the way if
00:01:32 :
you're not familiar with ustate I have a
00:01:34 :
whole video about that it's in the same
00:01:35 :
playlist that you're watching this video
00:01:37 :
now so if you're unfamiliar you want to
00:01:39 :
learn more about your state make sure to
00:01:40 :
go check out that video first then we
00:01:43 :
have another count but this one through
00:01:46 :
use ref and this one as well is
00:01:48 :
initialized with a value of zero then we
00:01:50 :
have this handle increment function
00:01:52 :
which is attached to this button right
00:01:54 :
here and when clicked it will first set
00:01:56 :
the count to count plus one so update
00:01:59 :
this State count to count plus 1
00:02:02 :
incremented by one and then it will do
00:02:05 :
the same thing to the ref it will
00:02:07 :
increment the ref by one now this dot
00:02:10 :
current thing here is actually how you
00:02:13 :
access values and how you mutate values
00:02:15 :
in your ref the value of a ref is always
00:02:18 :
going to be inside of this dot current
00:02:20 :
property whatever the value is in our
00:02:22 :
case it's zero it's a number if it was
00:02:24 :
an input if it was anything else you
00:02:26 :
would always access and mutate it with
00:02:28 :
the dot current property so this line
00:02:30 :
here 11 is just taking the value and
00:02:33 :
it's doing plus plus which is Javascript
00:02:35 :
notation for incremented by one so these
00:02:38 :
two lines are doing the same thing just
00:02:40 :
for both pieces of not state but both
00:02:43 :
counts essentially
00:02:45 :
and then we are logging the state count
00:02:48 :
and we are logging the ref count right
00:02:52 :
so let's see what happens if I do this
00:02:54 :
if I open up the console
00:02:56 :
and then clear everything what will
00:02:58 :
happen when I press increment so I press
00:03:00 :
increment and first of all the count has
00:03:03 :
been updated to one because the count
00:03:05 :
here is used in this return function and
00:03:07 :
it's displayed here this is the count
00:03:09 :
from the state so the state count we
00:03:11 :
know that is now 1 as a result of me
00:03:14 :
pressing this increment button if we
00:03:16 :
look here at the console we're going to
00:03:18 :
see that state logged as 0 and ref
00:03:21 :
locked as one now this is very
00:03:24 :
interesting and I want you to pay
00:03:26 :
attention because this is really
00:03:28 :
important that you understand why State
00:03:30 :
logged is zero and why ref log this one
00:03:33 :
so looking at this function here let's
00:03:36 :
first talk about the state right we are
00:03:38 :
incrementing the state and then we are
00:03:40 :
console logging the state after it has
00:03:42 :
been incremented just like I talked
00:03:45 :
about in the video that I did on you
00:03:46 :
State State updates one particular
00:03:49 :
property that they have is that they
00:03:51 :
happen and they trigger a new render a
00:03:54 :
new render of the component and the
00:03:56 :
updated value is only accessible in that
00:03:59 :
new render so what react is going to do
00:04:02 :
when we do this set count count plus one
00:04:04 :
is it's going to update the state of
00:04:06 :
count to count plus one it's going to
00:04:09 :
then continue running the body of the
00:04:11 :
function running any other hooks or
00:04:13 :
anything else that we might have in this
00:04:15 :
component right it doesn't stop
00:04:18 :
rendering altogether just because we're
00:04:20 :
updating the state it's going to
00:04:21 :
continue to finish the work and then
00:04:23 :
once all of the work has been done it's
00:04:25 :
going to then trigger a re-render
00:04:28 :
and that we render is going to have
00:04:30 :
access to the new value which is how
00:04:33 :
we're seeing it here on the screen right
00:04:35 :
this is because the component has
00:04:37 :
re-rendered since we press this
00:04:38 :
increment button and in that next render
00:04:41 :
we have access to the new updated value
00:04:44 :
which is one however this console log
00:04:48 :
here is not running in the next render
00:04:51 :
it's still running in that first initial
00:04:53 :
render when we click the button so when
00:04:56 :
even though we did set count here that
00:04:58 :
value as we said is only accessible in
00:05:01 :
the next render and so this console log
00:05:04 :
here is going to reference the old value
00:05:06 :
which was zero right that is how you
00:05:08 :
state Works only in the next render
00:05:11 :
which in our case only when we press
00:05:13 :
this increment button again will we then
00:05:15 :
have access to the new value of that
00:05:17 :
previous render so if I do this
00:05:19 :
you see that now we have access to State
00:05:22 :
one right that was the updated value of
00:05:25 :
the previous render however as you can
00:05:27 :
see now we're at count two right we're
00:05:30 :
always lacking behind one render that is
00:05:33 :
okay that is normal that is how you
00:05:35 :
state works right but now if you look at
00:05:38 :
ref it's different ref right logged one
00:05:43 :
right off the bat and then I press the
00:05:45 :
button again and it logged two right off
00:05:48 :
the bat so it functions very differently
00:05:50 :
than you state and that's okay that's
00:05:52 :
expected
00:05:53 :
ref will allow you to make updates and
00:05:57 :
to read the updated value instantly
00:06:00 :
without waiting for a re-render and the
00:06:03 :
reason you don't wait for a re-render is
00:06:05 :
because use ref doesn't even trigger a
00:06:08 :
new re-render in the first place that's
00:06:10 :
not what it's for if you need a new
00:06:12 :
re-render then you have to use state if
00:06:15 :
you don't then you use use ref that is
00:06:17 :
what I meant in the beginning of the
00:06:19 :
video when I said that use ref is a hook
00:06:21 :
that is used for Value that is not
00:06:23 :
needed for rendering that is how we're
00:06:26 :
able to have access to this new value
00:06:27 :
right away so when you increment the
00:06:30 :
count of the ref here you can console
00:06:33 :
log it right away and get access to the
00:06:35 :
new value right away that is a property
00:06:37 :
of ref of use ref now let me drive your
00:06:40 :
attention to what happens if instead of
00:06:42 :
discount here instead of the state count
00:06:44 :
in our return function what happens if I
00:06:47 :
replace this with the ref so I'll do
00:06:50 :
ref.current counterf.current and then in
00:06:53 :
the increment function I'm just going to
00:06:55 :
get rid of anything about State because
00:06:58 :
I don't want to trigger a re-render
00:07:00 :
through state right I only want to
00:07:02 :
manipulate the ref and see how our
00:07:04 :
component behaves now so I'm just going
00:07:06 :
to refresh so we have a clean slate and
00:07:08 :
if I press increment the count stayed at
00:07:12 :
0 but the ref logged as one I press
00:07:16 :
increment again the count still stays at
00:07:18 :
zero but the ref locked at 2 right this
00:07:22 :
is interesting but by now hopefully it
00:07:25 :
should make sense refs do not cause a
00:07:28 :
component to re-render and so if you
00:07:31 :
were to use it inside of this return
00:07:32 :
function you would not get the updated
00:07:35 :
value because that does not trigger a
00:07:38 :
component to re-render you would only
00:07:40 :
get the updated value if you have
00:07:42 :
something else that triggers the
00:07:44 :
component to re-render for example if we
00:07:46 :
re-added the set count here and then
00:07:49 :
just refreshed we would increment again
00:07:52 :
and now we would see ref1 and count one
00:07:55 :
increment again ref2 and count two we're
00:07:58 :
getting the most up-to-date value but
00:08:00 :
not because of ref we're getting it
00:08:02 :
because of State because of this set
00:08:04 :
count here that is what is causing the
00:08:06 :
component to re-render to trigger a
00:08:08 :
re-render so that we get access to the
00:08:10 :
most up-to-date value and so that's what
00:08:13 :
I meant that you should never use ref
00:08:14 :
inside of this return function because
00:08:17 :
your application is not going to work as
00:08:19 :
expected and you're going to use ref for
00:08:22 :
something that is not intended to be
00:08:23 :
used for and now let's talk about
00:08:25 :
another use case of ref one that you
00:08:27 :
might be more familiar with which is
00:08:29 :
using it with input elements or any
00:08:31 :
other HTML element in this case I just
00:08:34 :
have a simple ref which can be of type
00:08:36 :
HTML input element or null and then we
00:08:39 :
are passing it here to this input
00:08:41 :
element inside of the return function so
00:08:44 :
this is fine right we're not using dot
00:08:46 :
current here we're just passing the
00:08:48 :
reference of the ref to this input
00:08:49 :
opponent and this is allowed this is one
00:08:52 :
of the only use cases where you can use
00:08:54 :
a ref directly in the return function
00:08:56 :
and the reason you do this is because if
00:08:58 :
you do that react is going to handle
00:09:01 :
setting the dot current property of the
00:09:04 :
ref to the input as long as it's mounted
00:09:06 :
right the moment that the input becomes
00:09:09 :
unmounted whether the component unmounts
00:09:10 :
or some other reason react is going to
00:09:13 :
automatically handle removing the dot
00:09:16 :
current from The Ref right so you get
00:09:17 :
that benefit if you do it this way and
00:09:20 :
doing it this way right you have a ref
00:09:22 :
you pass it here to the input you can
00:09:24 :
then access some of the functions from
00:09:27 :
that input like for example this Focus
00:09:29 :
function right here this use effect what
00:09:31 :
we'll do is when the component is
00:09:33 :
mounted and everything else is rendered
00:09:34 :
because hooks always run after things
00:09:36 :
are rendered this input ref will be set
00:09:39 :
by react automatically to this input and
00:09:42 :
then you can call input ref.current
00:09:44 :
question mark right because we've
00:09:46 :
defined it as a type that it can't be
00:09:48 :
null right so typescript does doesn't
00:09:50 :
know that react will automatically
00:09:51 :
handle this for us but you can call the
00:09:54 :
focus function on this input on Mount
00:09:57 :
right which is going to focus here if I
00:09:59 :
just refresh the page it's going to
00:10:01 :
automatically Focus the input on month
00:10:03 :
which is a very useful thing to have in
00:10:05 :
an application perhaps you have a form
00:10:07 :
right and you want to facilitate the
00:10:08 :
user experience by having the first
00:10:10 :
input that makes sense be automatically
00:10:12 :
focused on mobile that's also going to
00:10:14 :
trigger the keyboard right this is a
00:10:16 :
feature that you would want you would
00:10:17 :
have to use a ref to accomplish that
00:10:19 :
feature so refs beside using values that
00:10:22 :
are not needed for rendering are also
00:10:24 :
useful if you want to access directly
00:10:26 :
HTML Dom elements and call functions on
00:10:29 :
those elements you can also use it
00:10:31 :
perhaps you've used it as well with
00:10:33 :
third-party libraries that create a ref
00:10:35 :
and then expose that ref along with some
00:10:37 :
functions so that you can access from
00:10:39 :
anywhere the functions of inside of that
00:10:42 :
component that is also a use case for
00:10:44 :
ref although that's not usually one that
00:10:46 :
you would write yourself you would just
00:10:47 :
more generally create a ref and pass it
00:10:49 :
and then by the documentation to Sweet
00:10:51 :
of the different functions that you can
00:10:53 :
call and work on it that way still refs
00:10:56 :
are a very powerful feature in react and
00:10:58 :
you really have to spend the time to
00:11:00 :
understand how they work what they're
00:11:02 :
used for what's the difference between
00:11:03 :
ref and state and how you can use it
00:11:05 :
with elements and also in third-party
00:11:08 :
libraries please take the time to really
00:11:10 :
focus and pun intended right Focus
00:11:13 :
really focus and understand what ref is
00:11:16 :
and how to use it and you will be a much
00:11:17 :
better react developer cool so there you
00:11:20 :
go another tutorial in the books this
00:11:22 :
was used buff I really hope that now you
00:11:24 :
have a better understanding of this hook
00:11:25 :
and how to use it and you can now go and
00:11:28 :
work on it in your own applications try
00:11:30 :
it out try the difference between that
00:11:31 :
and state and like I said you will
00:11:33 :
become a much better developer spend all
00:11:35 :
the time that you need and that is
00:11:37 :
required to really properly understand
00:11:40 :
this if you've enjoyed this video if you
00:11:42 :
got any value from it whatsoever please
00:11:44 :
do make sure to leave a subscribe leave
00:11:46 :
a like because it really does help me
00:11:47 :
out a lot it shows me that you enjoy
00:11:49 :
this type of content and that you want
00:11:51 :
more and trust me as you can see I'm

00:11:55 :
there's a lot more coming I love doing
00:11:57 :
this also if you want to learn more
00:11:59 :
about react and just be part of a
00:12:02 :
community of react developers and also
00:12:04 :
have access to me to answer your
00:12:06 :
questions look at your code help you
00:12:08 :
become a better developer I've created a
00:12:11 :
Discord for react developers there's a
00:12:13 :
link in the description you can join
00:12:15 :
it's completely for free we have about
00:12:17 :
like a hundred members and growing and
00:12:19 :
I'm there every day answering questions
00:12:22 :
reviewing code and I'm trying to create
00:12:24 :
the best community of react developers
00:12:26 :
on the internet so if that's of interest
00:12:28 :
to you there's a link in the description
00:12:30 :
make sure to go there and join and I
00:12:32 :
would love to see you on the Discord
00:12:33 :
with that being said my name has been
00:12:35 :
there as cousin this is cousin Solutions
00:12:37 :
it's been an absolute pleasure and I'll

### Summary
The video is a tutorial on the use of the useRef hook in React, explaining its purpose in storing and mutating values that do not trigger re-renders in components.

### Analogy
Using useRef is like having a notepad to write down information that you want to reference quickly without needing to redraw the entire picture.

https://www.youtube.com/

### Notes
- 💡 useRef is used for storing values that do not trigger component re-renders.
- 💡 State in React triggers re-renders, while useRef does not.
- 💡 useRef is useful for accessing and manipulating DOM elements directly.

### Keywords
- **useRef**: A React hook used for storing mutable values that do not trigger re-renders.
- **re-render**: The process of updating and refreshing the component's UI based on changes in state or props.

### Complex Words
- **useRef**: A built-in React hook used for storing values that do not trigger re-renders.
- **incremented**: To increase or add to a value.
- **re-render**: The process of updating and refreshing the component's appearance based on changes in state or props.
- **manipulate**: To handle or control something, often with the intention of changing it.`
